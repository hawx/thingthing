		<div class="content">
		  <p>The Esendex Perl SMS SDK acts as a wrapper library that exposes a FormPost interface to enable developers to integrate SMS functionality into their applications. This provides easy, reliable communication over secure and non-secure services.</p>

		  <p>You can download the latest Perl SDK by clicking <a href="/Downloads/Perl-SMS-SDK-Download.html">here</a>.</p>

		  <h3>Installing the SDK</h3>

		  <p>The Esendex Perl SMS SDK was developed using version 5.8.6 of ActivePerl and it is recommended you download and install the latest version before you use the SDK from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">Activestate</a>.</p>

		  <p>The SDK uses SSL via the LWP::UserAgent library. For a secure connection (which Esendex highly recommends), this requires the installation of the Crypt::SSLeay module if it is not already installed in your Perl library.</p>

		  <h3>Using the classes in your code</h3>

		  <p>Once you have installed the Perl FormPost SDK into a directory accessible from your web application, you can send a Message as follows:</p>
		  <pre>
use EsendexSendService;
my $message = new EsendexSendService($username, $password, $account );
my $response = $message -&gt; sendMessage($recipient, $body );
</pre>

		  <h3>Samples</h3>

		  <p>You can find the complete SDK documentation and more examples on using each of the SDK classes, an example Account Event Handler, and more information on the installation in the Perl FormPost SDK download which can be found in our <a href="/SDKs.html">Downloads</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
