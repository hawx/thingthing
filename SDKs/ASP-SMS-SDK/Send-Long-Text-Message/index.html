		  <p>Sending a Long&nbsp;SMS is the same as sending a text Message from a code point of view but there are some technical differences that you need to take into account. See <a href="/SDKs/ASP-SMS-SDK/Send-SMS">Send SMS</a> for a walkthrough of sending an SMS.</p>

		  <p>Firstly, you need to make sure that you have Long Messaging ticked as an option in your Account. To check / change this log into <a href="http://www.esendex.com" title="www.esendex.com">www.esendex.com</a> with your username and password and go to the options page for your Account. There is a tick box called <strong>Allow API Long Messaging</strong>, tick this and you will be able to send long Messages with the ASP SDK.</p>

		  <p>A Long Message is any Message over 160 characters in length. Basically, up to 160 characters your message will be sent in one part to the handset, over 160 characters the message will be split into multiple parts and one Message will be debited from your Account for each part sent. The parts will be 156 characters in length and the maximum length the Message can be is 620 characters long.</p>
