		  <p>It looks like quite a lot but it's very simple when broken down.<br>
		  In order to send a Message you first need to instantiate a <code>Esendex.SendService.2</code> object</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
dim sendService
set sendService = Server.CreateObject("Esendex.SendService.2")
</pre>

		  <p>This object has several methods that you can use to send a Message and check on the Message's status and it also has a method called <code>Initialise</code>.</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
sendService.Initialise Request.Form("Username"), Request.Form("Password"), Request.Form("Account") 
</pre>

		  <p>This is where you pass in your Account details and this is required for all of the other methods on the Send Service to work. As you can see the Account details are <strong>Username, Password</strong> and <strong>Account</strong>. These are the user name and password that you use to sign in to the website and the Account is your Account Reference, this usually starts with <strong>EX00</strong> and is followed by five numbers i.e. EX0012345.</p>

		  <p>Now that you've instantiated and initialised your sendService object you can send a Message, simply call the SendMessage method.</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint">
dim messageID
messageID = sendService.SendMessage(Request.Form("recipient"), Request.Form("body"), 1) 
</pre>

		  <p>The SendMessage method returns a Message Id which is a unique identifier in our database for the message that you sent. It's best if you store these Message Id's as you can use them to check on the status of a Message and you will need them if you contact support with a query about a particular Message.</p>

		  <p>To actually send the Message three parameters are required, <strong>Recipient, Body</strong> and <strong>Type</strong>. The first two are self-explanatory, the mobile number to send to and the content of the Message. The third parameter, type, is the type of Message you wish to send. Usually you will set this to 1 which is type <strong>Text</strong> but you can also set it to <strong>Binary (2), SmartMessage (3)</strong> or <strong>Unicode (4)</strong>.</p>
