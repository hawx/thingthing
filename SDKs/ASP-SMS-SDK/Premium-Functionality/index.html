		  <p>There is specific functionality provided by the SDK for customers who wish to have a premium rate short code. This functionality is all accessed by the Account Event Handler, for information on how to set up an Account Event Handler see <a href="/SDKs/ASP-SMS-SDK/Account-Event-Handler">Account Event Handler</a>.</p>

		  <h2>Subscription Event</h2>

		  <p>The particular event that corresponds to premium rate traffic is the Subscription Event. You will receive a subscription event when an SMS is sent to your short code for one of three things:</p>

		  <ol>
			<li>A new user is subscribing to your service.</li>

			<li>An existing user is unsubscribing from your service.</li>

			<li>A previously subscribed user wishes to re-subscribe.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p>In all of the above cases you will receive both the subscription event and a message, as two separate events. The following is a breakdown of a subscription event.<br>
		  <strong>Mobile</strong>: This is the mobile number that the event came from.<br>
		  <strong>Contact ID</strong>: This is the unique identifier that Esendex assigns to the contact object for this user.<br>
		  <strong>Event Type</strong>: This is the type of the event that has been received, subscribe, unsubscribe or resubscribe.<br>
		  <strong>Occurred At</strong>: This is the time we received the Message.</p>

		  <p>Depending on what your requirements are you will have to strip the details out of the event and process them, the following example on the <a href="/SDKs/ASP-SMS-SDK/Account-Event-Handler">Account Event Handler</a> page simply writes the details to a file.</p>
