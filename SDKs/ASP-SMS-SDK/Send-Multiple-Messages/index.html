		  <p>To send a Message to multiple mobile phone numbers with one method call you need to call the <strong>SendMessageMultipleRecipients</strong> method of the send service 2 object. An example page of how to do this is included in the zip file that you downloaded, the script for it is as follows</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
		  function processForm()

' Turn off error handling as we will handle any errors ourselves
on error resume next

' Create the service object
dim sendService
set sendService = Server.CreateObject("Esendex.SendService.2")

' Was there a problem setting up the object?
if err.number &lt;&gt; 0 then
processForm = "Unable to create Esendex.SendService.2 object. Ensure COM object is registered. Error description: " + err.Description
exit function
end if

' Setup the send service object
sendService.Initialise Request.Form("Username"), Request.Form("Password"), Request.Form("Account")

' Attempt to send the messages
dim messageIDs
set messageIDs = sendService.SendMessageMultipleRecipients(Request.Form("recipients"), Request.Form("body"), 1)
' Handle any errors
if err.number &lt;&gt; 0 then
processForm = "Unable to send message: " + err.Description
exit function
else
processForm = "The messages were delivered. The message id's were: "
Dim index
for index = 1 To messageIDs.Count
processForm = processForm + messageIDs(index) + ", "
next
end if
end function
</pre>

		  <p>If you break this down you will see that it's very similar to sending a text Message but with a different method call on the Send Service object. You start by creating a Send Service object.</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
dim sendService
set sendService = Server.CreateObject("Esendex.SendService.2") 
</pre>

		  <p>Next you have to initialise the Send Service object with your Account details.</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
sendService.Initialise Request.Form("Username"), Request.Form("Password"), Request.Form("Account")
</pre>

		  <p>The Account details are the user name and password that you sign into the website with and your Account Reference, usually starting EX00 followed by five numbers, i.e. EX0012345.</p>

		  <p>Now that the Send Service knows which Account to use you can send your Message.</p>
		  <pre class="prettyprint lang-vb">
		  dim messageIDs         
set messageIDs = sendService.SendMessageMultipleRecipients(Request.Form("recipients"), Request.Form("body"), 1)
</pre>

		  <p>The main differences between this method and SendMessage are the recipients and the return value. The recipients parameter is a comma delimited string of the mobile numbers you want to send your Message to i.e. "447712345678, 447798765432". The return value is now an array of Message Ids instead of a single Message Id.</p>

		  <p>The array is ordered in the same order as your recipients. The other parameters in the method call are the same as SendMessage. <strong>Body</strong> is the message you want to send and <strong>Type</strong> is the type of the Message. In this case the type is set to 1, which is text but you can also set the type to <strong>Binary (2), SmartMessage (3)</strong> or <strong>Unicode (4)</strong>. One thing to note is that duplicate numbers are removed from the recipients string before the Messages are sent, for example.</p>

		  <p>If you had a recipients list of "447700900123, 447700900123, 447700900456", only two Messages would be sent, one to 447700900123 and one to 447700900456. You would also only get back two Message Ids.</p>
