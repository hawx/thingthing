	  <div class="node">
		<div class="content">
		  <p>Esendex provides an ActiveX component with a COM interface that enables you to integrate your applications written in COM-compliant languages such as VB6, ASP, Delphi and C++, with our services.</p>

		  <p>The component has features that enable you to send text messages, query the status of messages, retrieve messages from your inbox, manage your contacts and get information about your account.</p>

		  <p>As with all COM components, you must first register it with the system. To do this, type the following from a command prompt:</p>

		  <p><code>REGSVR32 EsendexSdk2.DLL</code></p>

		  <p>You will see a message that the component has been successfully registered.</p>

		  <p>To find out more about the ActiveX component download the <a href="/SDKs">Esendex SDK</a> for your language of choice and read the documentation contained within it.</p>

		  <h5>Note: This component is not compatible with 64bit versions of Windows</h5>

		  <p>&nbsp;</p>

		  <h3>Status Codes</h3>

		  <p>You may encounter the status of an individual message represented as an integer.<br>
		  1. Submitted<br>
		  3. Failed Authorisation<br>
		  4. Queued<br>
		  5. Sent<br>
		  6. Delivered<br>
		  11. Failed<br>
		  16. Expired</p>

		  <p><strong>Submitted</strong> is the status a message gets when it has been received by us.<br>
		  <strong>Failed Authorisation</strong> occurs if you try to send a premium message to a mobile that is not subscribed to your service.<br>
		  <strong>Queued</strong> means we have received your message and it has been queued ready for sending to the network provider.<br>
		  <strong>Sent</strong> is the status you will get once we have submitted a message to the network provider.<br>
		  <strong>Delivered</strong> means that we have received a delivery receipt back from the network provider.<br>
		  <strong>Failed</strong> is a general failure status for the message, the message either failed in our system or with the network provider.<br>
		  <strong>Expired</strong> is set when the network provider was unable to deliver the message to the destination within the validity period.</p>

		  <h3>Error Codes</h3>

		  <p>If an error occurs when using the ActiveX component, you will need to perform an additional step to be able to determine the <a href="/ActiveX-SMS-SDK/Error-Codes">error code</a>.</p>

		  <p>The returned error number needs to be logically AND'd with the hex value FFFF. This strips the COM error number out and leaves behind the Esendex error code.</p>

		  <p>The following is an example of how this is achieved in ASP (VBScript):</p>

		  <p><code>if err.number &lt;&gt; 0 then<br>
		  'Get the error code!<br>
		  Dim errorCode errorCode = err.number And &amp;HFFFF<br>
		  end if</code></p>
