<h1 class="title">REST</h1>

<div class="node">
  <div class="content">
    <p>The REST API (application programming interface) is simple, lightweight and built on simple and established standards that reduce the need for special toolkits. This allows Esendex to support a wider range of programming languages more easily than ever before.</p>

    <p>This document describes the REST interactions the API offers to the business messaging services provided by Esendex. It is intended to provide all the information required to get started using the API.</p>

    <p>The REST API has been based on the REST architectural style and has been implemented on the HTTP protocol. It uses the standard HTTP methods of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to interact with a set of defined resources. The requests made to and the responses from the REST API are UTF-8 encoded XML representations.</p>

    <p>In order to use the REST API, the following items are required:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An active internet connection</li>

      <li>Handling for HTTP Request/Response objects</li>

      <li>XML Parsing functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>REST Principles</h2>

    <p>The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture was defined by Roy Fielding in 2000. It describes how clients can make requests to a server on a set of defined &acirc;&euro;&tilde;resources&acirc;&euro;&trade; and get an appropriate response back.</p>

    <p>By using basic HTTP method verbs to specific resource URIs (uniform resource identifier) using request and response headers, interactions with a REST API mirrors the basic principles that the Internet is built on.</p>

    <h2>HTTP Methods</h2>

    <p>There are four main HTTP methods or verbs which are used to interact with the REST API. These are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.</p>

    <p>The use of these verbs describes operations on a resource in the following manner:</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>GET</dt>

      <dd>Retrieves a representation of the requested resource (current state)</dd>

      <dt>POST</dt>

      <dd>Create a new instance of a resource</dd>

      <dt>PUT</dt>

      <dd>Update an existing instance of a resource</dd>

      <dt>DELETE</dt>

      <dd>Remove an existing instance of a resource</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>

    <p>When interacting with the REST API, any HTTP responses will have an accompanying Status Code to indicate the success or failure of the operation you requested. Here is a list of the common ones used:</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>200</dt>

      <dd>OK</dd>

      <dt>400</dt>

      <dd>Bad Request</dd>

      <dt>402</dt>

      <dd>Payment Required</dd>

      <dt>403</dt>

      <dd>Not Authorised</dd>

      <dt>404</dt>

      <dd>Resource Not Found</dd>

      <dt>405</dt>

      <dd>Method not Allowed</dd>

      <dt>408</dt>

      <dd>Request Timed Out</dd>

      <dt>409</dt>

      <dd>Concurrency ID mismatch</dd>

      <dt>412</dt>

      <dd>Precondition Failed</dd>

      <dt>500</dt>

      <dd>Problem with REST API</dd>

      <dt>503</dt>

      <dd>Server Under Maintenance</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>API Access</h2>

    <p>In order to allow customers to manage what their users can do on their account, access to the API is restricted to users with <strong>Admin</strong> and <strong>Standard</strong> roles on an account (in most cases this shouldn't be an issue as <strong>Admin</strong> is the default role of new users).</p>

    <p>To manage the roles of users on an account, once you've signed up:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Log in to <a title="Echo" href="https://www.esendex.com/echo">Echo</a></li>

      <li>Go to Settings -&gt; User Management</li>
    </ul>
