<div class="node">
  <div class="content">
    <p>For requests on resources which generate a
    response the REST API will return an appropriate
    representation of the result in UTF-8 encoded XML.
    This section details the types of representation
    objects that describe the state of the resources
    being queried or manipulated. With each data
    representation, a list of expected Fields will be
    listed.</p>
    <h2>Paged Representations</h2>
    <p>When exposing certain large collections of data to
    the user, the REST API will return a subset of that
    information in a paged representation. Paged
    representations will have three defined XML
    attributes to give information on the scope of the
    current response and the overall size of the data
    collection.</p>
    <p>For example, when the Inbox resource returns a
    collection of Message Header objects these are
    contained within a MessageHeaders XML element.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;messageheaders startindex="0" count="15" totalcount="239"&gt;
&lt;messageheader …</pre>
    <p>In this example,</p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>startindex="0"</dt>
      <dd>The index of the first message in the returned
      data; the index of the first object of any
      collection is 0</dd>
      <dt>count="15"</dt>
      <dd>The number of messages returned.</dd>
      <dt>totalcount="239"</dt>
      <dd>The total number of messages in the Inbox.
      Further pages of data can be retrieved by making
      additional requests to the resource by shifting the
      startIndex value.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Paged collections have a maximum page size and
    requests for a larger ‘count’ value than is permitted
    will be reduced to the maximum allowed.</p>
