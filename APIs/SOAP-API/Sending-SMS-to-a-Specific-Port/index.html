      <div class="node">
        <div class="content">
          <p>Recently we seem to be getting more and more
          support cases raised asking if we support sending an
          SMS text message to a specific port on a
          handset.&nbsp; The short answer to this is yes, but
          it is considered to be an advanced subject that most
          users won't need to do and is very much a manual
          process.&nbsp; So if you're willing to roll up your
          sleeves and dive into this, then please read on, but
          expect a little preamble before we get to the bones
          of it.&nbsp; Also, I'm assuming you know how to
          consume a Web Service, or make HTTP post calls to a
          web page.</p>
          <p><strong>Please note that this is not supported on
          the REST API.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A Brief Introduction to SMPP and
          PDUs</strong></p>
          <p>Most of our connections to network operators are
          through the SMPP protocol (see <a href=
          "http://www.smsforum.net/">smsforum.net</a> for
          downloads of the specification).&nbsp; To send an SMS
          to a specific port requires at least a rudimentary
          grasp of the concepts involved in this protocol,
          particularly the SubmitSM protocol data unit (or
          PDU).&nbsp; In the loosest possible terms SMPP works
          using request and response PDUs.&nbsp; In order to
          send a message, we send a SubmitSM PDU to the
          operator, who then sends back a response PDU to say
          they have accepted it.</p>
          <p>A SubmitSM PDU contains everything the operator
          requires to send one text message: the originator and
          destination mobile numbers (in the source and
          destination address parameters), the message text to
          send (in the user data section), and a number of
          other parameters that we need to set in order to
          describe the content of the message.</p>
          <p>The two most important of these other parameters
          are the data coding scheme, and the ESM class.&nbsp;
          The data coding scheme (or DCS) is used to describe
          how the bytes in the user data section of the PDU are
          encoded.&nbsp; The ESM class describes special
          attributes that are applied to the message (more on
          this later).</p>
          <p>Importantly, <strong>there are no parameters in a
          SubmitSM PDU that directly take the source and
          destination ports</strong> of the application on the
          handset to send the message to.</p>
          <p>So how do we specify port values in the PDU if
          there are no parameters for them?&nbsp; We place a
          header on the user data section.</p>
          <p><strong>Introduction to User Data Headers
          (UDH)</strong></p>
          <p>A UDH is a series of bytes within the user data
          section of a SubmitSM PDU.&nbsp; A standard text
          message does not have a UDH, so is treated like a
          normal text message on the phone and is delivered to
          the standard message inbox.&nbsp; A UDH can contain
          port and concatenation information, which tells the
          handset where to send the message, and if there are
          any further parts of the message it needs to wait
          for.</p>
          <p>We only need to know about the port information in
          the UDH for the purposes of this example.</p>
          <p>Here is a stream of bytes (hex encoded) that would
          be in the user data section of the PDU for a WAP Push
          message (as a WAP Push message needs to contain port
          information):</p>
          <p>
          <code>0605040B8423F025060A03AE81EAAF828DADB48401056A0045C60C0364657670726F6A32302E626C6F6773706F742
          E636F6D2F000801034D7920426C6F67000101</code></p>
          <p>The header of this message is this:</p>
          <p><code>0605040B8423F0</code></p>
          <p>The first three bytes here (060504) describe
          various lengths within the header.&nbsp; The port
          information is contained within the next four bytes
          (0B8423F0).&nbsp; So in summary the entire message
          can be broken down as:</p>
          <p>060504: Length indicators<br />
          0B84: Destination port (2948)&nbsp;<br />
          23F0: Originator port (9200)<br />
          25060.... : the actual message bytes describing the
          URL and a piece of text.</p>
          <p>Therefore, a WAP Push message is a series of bytes
          with a UDH that specifies destination port 2948, and
          source port 9200.&nbsp; But as headers are optional
          on a user data section, how does the phone know if
          one is present?&nbsp; We indicate this in the ESM
          class parameter of the PDU.</p>
          <p><strong>UDH Indicator and Data Coding</strong></p>
          <p>The ESM class parameter plays a very powerful role
          in how the message is interpreted and displayed on
          the phone, and it's just one byte.&nbsp; Combinations
          of individual bits within this byte indicate
          different requirements, but the one we're interested
          in is the UDH Indicator.&nbsp; If you set these bits
          (and don't need any others set) the value of the ESM
          class byte is 64 (0x40), and this indicates that a
          UDH is present in the user data section.</p>
          <p>The DCS parameter comes into play here by
          indicating how the bytes after the header (if one is
          present) are to be decoded.&nbsp; In a normal message
          with no header this parameter is set to 0, which
          indicates the default alphabet used by the
          operator.&nbsp; In a Wap Push message this is set to
          4 to indicate 8-bit binary.</p>
          <p><strong>So how do I send a message to a
          port?</strong></p>
          <p>Now you're familiar with the concepts, I'll
          finally get around to telling you what you're reading
          this post for.&nbsp; We expose an Advanced Send
          Service as a&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://www.esendex.com/secure/messenger/soap/AdvancedSendService.asmx">SOAP
          Service</a>, and via&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://www.esendex.com/secure/messenger/formpost/SendAdvancedSMS.aspx">FormPost</a>.&nbsp;
          If you take a look at one of these you will see
          ESMClass and DataCodingScheme parameters (see, I told
          you they were important, so if you've just skipped to
          here and don't know what I'm talking about, go back
          and read everything).</p>
          <p>Let's have an example.&nbsp; Say you need to send
          a text message "ab"(without the quotes) to port 5000
          (for actual port values you'll have to consult the
          documentation for the application you are sending
          to).&nbsp;</p>
          <p><em>1. Construct the header</em></p>
          <p>You'll need to construct the header and encode the
          text onto the end of it.</p>
          <p>For this example the header will be:</p>
          <p><code>06050413880000</code></p>
          <p>Because:</p>
          <p>060504: Length indicators<br />
          1388: Destination port (5000)<br />
          0000: Originator port (zero it if you don't need a
          specific one)</p>
          <p><em>2. Encode your text</em></p>
          <p>Encode your text to ASCII and append to the
          header.&nbsp; The text "ab" is 0x6162, so your full
          message with header is:</p>
          <p><code>060504138800006162</code></p>
          <p><em>3. Submit the message</em></p>
          <p>In this case the value for the ESMClass parameter
          will be 64, and the DataCodingScheme should be set to
          0.&nbsp; Put the string <em>060504138800006162</em>
          as the body parameter, enter values for the rest of
          the parameters (originator, destination, etc.) and
          submit.</p>
          <p>And that's it.&nbsp; As long as your header is
          correct and you've encoded the text correctly you
          should have the message delivered to the application
          on the phone that needs it.</p>
          <p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>
          <p>Some things to be aware of when submitting
          messages like this</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Commonly, if the handset you are sending to
            cannot interpret the message you're sending it will
            just do nothing.&nbsp; You will get a delivery
            receipt for the message saying it has been
            delivered to the handset, but you will see nothing
            on the screen.&nbsp; This makes debugging very
            difficult.</li>
            <li>The body parameter (in this case) needs to be a
            hex encoded string of the bytes you wish to
            send.&nbsp; This means 2 hex characters per
            byte.&nbsp; i.e. 0xA should be sent as <em>0A</em>
            not just <em>A</em>.</li>
            <li>The values for the ESMClass and DCS should be
            decimal numbers</li>
            <li>With regards to character encoding, we have
            received scattered reports of some non-alphanumeric
            characters not being displayed correctly, but we
            haven't had been able to narrow down the cause of
            this.&nbsp; If you experience encoding problems
            please&nbsp;email <a href=
