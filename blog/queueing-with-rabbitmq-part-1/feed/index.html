		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin,
We have had a play with EasyNetQ, it seems like a nice library for the publish subscribe messaging pattern.
We actually use the stock client with a wrapper written by ourselves to achieve a variety of different messaging patterns and resilience. We have found many of the .NET RabbitMQ Clients out there to be too restrictive or to be designed around only event bus style message passing.
This is a introductory post, in the rest of this series we will talk about the features of RabbitMQ we find most helpful and will share some things we have learnt while using it.]]></description>
